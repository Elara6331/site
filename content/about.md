## Hello, I'm Elara!

I'm a passionate free and open source software developer who thrives on the challenge of problem solving in its myriad forms. Whether it's bringing a physical device to life using code, crafting elaborate web applications, or maintaining physical and cloud infrastructure, I have experience in the entire software lifecycle.

My skill set is very diverse, spanning embedded and systems programming, backend and frontend development, system administration, DevOps, and much more. 

Some of my achievements include:

- Maintaining a complex, automated server cluster that powers everything in my online world and provides free services to anyone who needs them ([link](https://gitea.elara.ws/Elara6331/nomad))
- Building a distribution and build system for Linux software ([link](https://lure.sh))
- Designing a custom templating language for Go ([link](https://gitea.elara.ws/Elara6331/salix/))
- Writing software to connect the open source [PineTime](https://pine64.org/devices/pinetime/) smartwatch to any Linux system ([link](https://gitea.elara.ws/Elara6331/itd))

I've also made significant contributions to many well-known open source projects, including [GoReleaser](https://github.com/goreleaser), [Fyne](https://github.com/fyne-io), [TinyGo](https://github.com/tinygo-org), [InfiniTime](https://github.com/InfiniTimeOrg/InfiniTime), and [Lemmy](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy).
